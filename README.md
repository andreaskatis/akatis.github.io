Hi there! My name is Andreas Katis and I am a Computer Scientist for KBR, Inc. and a member of NASA Ames's Robust Software Engineering group (RSE).
My research background is in the application of formal methods for the analysis of software systems, primarily at the level of requirements.
I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota in 2020, under the supervision of Dr. Michael W. Whalen. My PhD thesis was on the
development of realizability checking and reactive synthesis techniques for infinite-state problems.
