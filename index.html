			  Hi there! My name is Andreas Katis and I am a Computer Scientist for KBR, Inc. and a member of NASA Ames's <a href="https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/rse/">Robust Software Engineering group (RSE)</a>.
	                  My research background is in the application of formal methods for the analysis of software systems, primarily at the level of requirements.
			  I earned my BSc degree from the <a href="https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en">Computer Engineering and Informatics Department (C.E.I.D.)</a> at the University
			  of Patras. I received my MsC and PhD in Computer Science from the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs">University of Minnesota</a> in 2020, under the
			  supervision of Dr. Michael W. Whalen. My PhD thesis was on the development of realizability checking and reactive synthesis techniques for
			  infinite-state problems.
