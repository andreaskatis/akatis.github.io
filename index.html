Hi there! My name is Andreas Katis and I am a Computer Scientist for KBR, Inc. and a member of NASA Ames's Robust Software Engineering group (RSE). My research background is in the application of formal methods for the analysis of software systems, primarily at the level of requirements. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota in 2019, under the supervision of Michael W. Whalen. My PhD thesis was on the development of realizability checking and reactive synthesis techniques for infinite-state problems.

Current projects:

Formal Requirements Elicitation tool (FRET) : Integration of realizability checking analysis and diagnosis of unrealizable results
Contract based Compositional verification of Simulink models (CoCoSim) : Main developer and maintainer
